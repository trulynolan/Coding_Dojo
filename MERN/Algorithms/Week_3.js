//Intersect Sorted Arrays
//Given two sorted arrays, return a new array containing all the numbers they have in common
//This includes duplicates too! The intersection of [2,2] and [2,2,2] would be [2,2]

//Ex: given [2,4,7,9,10] and [2,3,5,7,9,10], return [2,7,9,10]
//Ex: given [1,1,4,5,8] and [1,1,1,5,6,8] return [1,1,5,8]
//Ex: given [1,3,5,7,9] and [2,4,6,8,10] return []
